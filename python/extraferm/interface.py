    Unified interface for Born rule probability calculation using extended matchgate simulation.

    This function automatically selects the appropriate simulation algorithm based on the
    provided parameters, offering three different approaches for calculating outcome probabilities:

    **Algorithm Selection:**

    1. **Raw Estimate**: Fixed Monte Carlo sampling with optional trajectory count.
       - Use when: You want to calculate probabilities for a large number of bitstrings quickly
       - Parameters: Provide either trajectory_count OR (additive_error, failure_probability, probability_upper_bound)
       - Performance: Fastest for multiple bitstrings - O(trajectory_count)

    2. **Estimate**: Uses adaptive calls to Raw Estiamte with theoretical error bounds.
       - Use when: You want very high accuracy for fewer bitstrings
       - Parameters: Provide additive_error and failure_probability
       - Performance: Adaptive - automatically determines sample size for guaranteed accuracy

    3. **Exact Calculation**: Returns exact probabilities by summing over all controlled-phase masks.
       - Use when: You need exact results and the circuit is small enough
       - Parameters: Only circuit and outcome_states required
       - Performance: O(2^k) where k is the number of controlled-phase gates

    **Automatic Optimizations:**
    - LUCJ circuits (pauli_x*, orb_rot_jw, controlled-phase, orb_rot_jw pattern) have optimized paths.

    Args:
        circuit: QuantumCircuit compatible with matchgate simulation
        outcome_states: Single outcome (int) or sequence of outcomes to calculate
        trajectory_count: Fixed number of Monte Carlo trajectories (for raw estimate)
        additive_error: Target additive error bound (for estimate/raw estimate)
        failure_probability: Failure probability (for estimate/raw estimate)
        probability_upper_bound: Upper bound on outcome probability (for raw estimate only)
        seed: Optional seed for reproducible results. Only valid for Monte Carlo methods (raw estimate/estimate), not exact calculation.

    Returns:
        float: Probability for single outcome_states
        np.ndarray: Array of probabilities for multiple outcome_states

    Examples:
        # Exact calculation
        prob = outcome_probabilities(circuit=qc, outcome_states=0b1010)

        # Adaptive estimate with error bounds
        prob = outcome_probabilities(circuit=qc, outcome_states=[0b1010, 0b0101], additive_error=0.01, failure_probability=0.05)

        # Raw estimate with fixed trajectory count
        prob = outcome_probabilities(circuit=qc, outcome_states=0b1010, trajectory_count=10000)

        # Raw estimate with accuracy bounds
        prob = outcome_probabilities(circuit=qc, outcome_states=[0b1010, 0b0101], additive_error=0.01, failure_probability=0.05, probability_upper_bound=0.1)

        # Reproducible results with seed
        prob = outcome_probabilities(circuit=qc, outcome_states=0b1010, trajectory_count=10000, seed=42)
